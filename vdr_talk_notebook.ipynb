    "### The Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1,134 vision papers at NeurIPS\n",
    "- 3 days to explore\n",
    "- Which 30-40 papers should you prioritize?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Visualize the Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load dataset → Compute embeddings → Generate UMAP\n",
    "\n",
    "- See what research clusters emerge: diffusion, transformers, 3D, video\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand: What's hot? What's emerging? Where do areas overlap?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Find Core Interests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic seach based on your interests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lasso entire clusters: Tag interesting papers as 'core_interest'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filter by presentation type: Oral vs Poster\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Discover Through Semantic Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find papers with similar research niches\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find papers similar to ones you already like\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discover cross-domain connections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Identify Novel Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sort by representativeness (low scores = outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Papers that don't fit existing categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential breakthroughs or ambitious cross-domain work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Build Your Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core papers + Adjacent + Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filter to oral presentations → 15 must-attend\n",
    "\n",
    "- Export personalized conference guide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
